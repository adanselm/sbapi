# SbAPI : A user management app in Elixir/[Phoenix] that includes an SSO service

This is what I use as an SSO server for [springbeats.com](springbeats.com) and our discourse forum at [discuss.springbeats.com](discuss.springbeats.com)

[Phoenix]: https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix

## Installation

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Change configuration for your different environments in `config/*.exs` (see below)
3. Start Phoenix router with `mix phoenix.start`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000/users` from your browser.

## Configuration

Specific parameters of this application:

```elixir
config :phoenix, :sso,
  db_config: %{ db_user: "db_user",
                db_pwd: "db_password",
                db_host: "db_host",
                db_port: "5432",
                db_name: "database",
                db_options: "ssl=true" },
  payload_secret: "my_payload_secret_as_defined_on_client",
  redirect_url: "http://localhost:8080/session/sso_login?"

config :bcrypt, [mechanism: :port, pool_size: 4]

config :exrecaptcha,
  api_config: %{ verify_url: "http://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/verify",
                 public_key: "my_google_public_key",
                 private_key: "my_google_private_key" }
```

* payload_secret: a secret token that the SSO client uses to encode the conversation
* redirect_url: once the authentication succeeded via SSO, redirects to this URL with the NONCE used for the initial request
* bcrypt stuff: I had difficulties using the nif version of bcrypt, so I went with the port version. Here you can tune the number of processes running for bcrypt.
* verify_url: Google ReCaptcha's verify url
* public_key, private_key: as given by Google on [https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#list](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#list)

## Notes

* For more information on the way SSO is implemented, please refer to [Discourse's website](https://meta.discourse.org/t/official-single-sign-on-for-discourse/13045), since it was done to comply to their protocol.
* If you choose to change the application's structure, you could manually start the router from your code like this `SbSso.Router.start`
